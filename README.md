# The Intern's Ship

**The Internâ€™s Ship** (TinS) is an **internship management application** built for Computing students to track and update the progress, status and information of all their internship applications in an organised and efficient manner.

Optimized for quick inputs using a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), if you can type fast, TinS can help you manage your internship applications more effectively than traditional apps.

### Features (v1.2)
* Add and Delete Internship applications
* List out key information of all applications
* View detailed information of applications
* Automatic saving of data

*Many More features to come!*
