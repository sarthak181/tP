### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram-0.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g. the `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `InfoPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Internship` object residing in the `Model`.

The abstract `Page` class represents the part of the GUI that displays information requested by the user. This may include details of an internship, existing clashes and etc. Note that a `Page` differs from `ResultDisplay`, which outputs the outcome of a command (e.g. success or failure) keyed in by the user. 

Different types of information are rendered by different components, each of which is represented by their own concrete `Page` subclasses, such as `InternshipInfoPage`, `ClashesInfoPage` and etc. 

![Subclasses of Page abstract class](images/PageClasses.png)

When the user executes a command, `Page` factory method `of` will be called and the result returned will be either of its concrete subclasses. The sequence diagram below illustrates the chain of method calls whenever a new Page is constructed to be displayed in the UI. 

![Subclasses of Page abstract class](images/PageSequenceDiagram.png)




### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternshipCatalogueParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an Internship).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipCatalogueParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InternshipCatalogueParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/internship/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* Model Stores Independent Entities(`Internship` and `Events`) which interact with each other to give the features of intern's ship
* For each entity :
  * model stores the entity catalogue data i.e., all `entity` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEntityList` object).
  * model stores the currently 'selected' `Entity` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* model also stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
  

#### Relationship Between `Internship` and `Event` entities
Events cannot exist without it's correponding internship, thus there exists a composite relationship between the two.
Also, to make insertions and deletions of events easier, each event instance stores the internship instance it is
associated with. Due to this, extra precautions are taken during internship deletions, making sure the corresponding
events are deleted as well.


<img src="images/InternshipEventModelClassDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save internship catalogue data, event catalogue data and user preference data in json format, and read them back
into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipCatalogueStorage`, `EventCatalogueStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be
treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.internship.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View Calendar feature
The view calendar feature displays all Events under existing Internships in a calendar rendered by third-party JavaFX library CalendarFX.
It is accessible by the command `calendar`.

#### Implementation
Given below is an example usage, and what happens at every step of the execution of the `calendar` command.

Step 1. The user enters `calendar` command into the CommandBox.

Step 2. `MainWindow` receives the input and calls `execute('calendar')`. `execute(String)` is a method declared in LogicManager.

Step 3. `InternshipCatalogueParser` parses the input and extracts the command String `calendar`. A `CalendarCommand` is then created.

Step 4. `LogicManager` calls `execute(Model)` method of the `CalendarCommand`. The argument is a `Model` instance stored in `LogicManager`.   

Step 5. In the method `execute`, `updateFilteredEventList(Predicate)` of the `Model` instance is called. `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS`, which is a `Predicate` that evaluates to `true` for all `Event` is passed as argument. As a result, the `Model` now maintains a list of all added `Events`. 

Step 6. The `execute` method then obtains the list of all `Event`s generated in `Model` instance, and creates a `CommandResult` that encapsulates it. The `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`. 

Step 7. `LogicManager` returns the `CommandResult` to `MainWindow`.

Step 8. In `MainWindow`'s `executeCommand` method, the `ResultType` of the `CommandResult` is recognized as `CALENDAR`, and `Page.of(CommandResult)` is called.

Step 9. `Page.of(CommandResult)` again detects that `ResultType` of the `CommandResult` is `CALENDAR`, and calls `new CalendarPage(commandResult.getEvents())`. 

Step 10. Within constructor of the `CalendarPage`, the necessary CalendarFX components are created and initialized with the current time.
Two crucial CalendarFX components used here include a `Calendar` and a `MonthPage`. A `Calendar` is a CalendarFX class that stores all events it receives, whereas `MonthPage` is a composite CalendarFX control that showcases all events by month in grids.

Step 11. Then, the list of `Event`s received by the `CalendarPage` constructor is added to `Calendar`, each as an `Entry`, a CalendarFX class that represents an event. If the `Event` is a deadline, then the `Entry` will be set as a full-day `Entry` with `setFullDay(true)`.

Step 12. The `CalendarPage` is constructed and now returned to the `MainWindow`, where it will be added as a children of `pagePlaceholder` for display on the GUI. 

To learn more about CalendarFX, you may visit its Developer Guide [here](https://dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh.github.io/CalendarFX/).

### Add Event feature 
The Add Event Event feature allows Users to Add Events/Deadlines to their selected internship.

#### Implementation
 1. User Selects the Internship they want to add the event to by executing ` Select <Internship Id>`. 

 2. User executes `event add na/<event name> st/<event start datetime> en/<event end datetime> de/<event description>` if they want to add an Event to their selected internship.

    2.1 User executes ` event add na/<event name> en/<event end datetime> de/<event description>` if they want to add a deadline to their selected internship.

The Activity Diagram for Add event is 

![EventAddActivityDiagram](images/EventAddActivityDiagram.png)

3. UI sends the Command to `Logic#InternshipCatalogueParser` , which uses the keyword `event` to identify this as an event command and sends the remainder of the command ` add na/... ` to `Logic#EventCatalogueParser`
4. `EventCatalogueParser` identifies the add event command using the keyword `add`, then calls the `EventAddCommandParser` passing the arguments (everything except the keyword `and`) to be parsed.
5. `EventAddCommandParser` tokenizes the arguments and creates an `Event` Object , which is then passed into a ` new EventAddCommand(event)` instance and the instance is returned by `EventAddCommandParser`.
6. Then `LogicManager` passes the current `model` instance to `execute` method of  `EventAddCommand` instance.
7. `EventAddCommand` instance uses the model object to find the `seletedInternship` and passes it to the `Event` object to initialise the `internship` variable inside the `Event` object.
8. `Event` object is then added to the `UniqueEventsList` using the `addEvent` method of `model`.

The Sequence Diagram for the adding the event is
![EventAddSequenceDiagram](images/EventAddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Select command feature

#### Implementation

The `select` command feature is standard command that extends `Command` and returns a `CommandResult` in the `execute()` method, which does the following:

* Update `currentInternship` field in `InternshipCatalogue` which stores the current selected `Internship` for use in other commands.
* Obtains a list of all the `Event` belonging to that `Internship`.
* Returns a `CommandResult` containing the `Internship` and its list of `Event`, to be passed to the UI for display.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters the `select` command into the CLI: `select 2`.

Step 2. `InternshipCatalogueParser` parses the input and extracts the command `select`, creating a `SelectCommandParser` and passing it `"2"` by calling its `parser()` method.

Step 3. `SelectCommandParser` parses the index `2` of the selected internship and creates a `SelectCommand` instance with that index and returns it up to `LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `SelectCommand` instance, which invokes `getFilteredInternshipList()` on `Model` to get a list of internships, and obtains the internship at index `2`.

Step 5. `SelectCommand` then passes that `Internship` instance through `updateSelectedInternship()` on `Model` which invokes `updateCurrent()` on `InternshipCatalogue` which updates its `currentInternship` field to that instance of `Internship`.

Step 6. `SelectCommand` also invokes `updateFilteredEventList()` and `getFilteredEventList()` on `Model` to obtain the list of `Event` belonging to that instance of `Internship` as `ObservableList<Event>`.

Step 7. Finally, a `CommandResult` is created containing that `Internship` and its `ObservableList<Event>` and it is returned to `LogicManager` for use in the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the select command works:

![SelectSequenceDiagram](images/SelectSequenceDiagram.png)

Note: The lifeline for `SelectCommand` should end at the destroy marker(X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

### Clash Command feature

#### Implementation
The purpose of the `clash` command is for users to finding events with clashing timing, enabling them to reschedule
clashing events.

The `clash` command feature is standard command that extends `Command` and returns a `CommandResult` in the
`execute()` method.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters the `clash` command into the CLI.

Step 2. `InternshipCatalogueParser` parses the input and extracts the command `clash`, and creates a new `ClashCommand`.

Step 3. `LogicManager` calls the `execute()` method of the `ClashCommand` instance, 
which invokes `getEventCatalogue()` on `Model` to get the current Event Catalogue of TinS.

Step 4. The `findClashEvents` is then called on `eventCatalogue`, which invokes a series of methods to loop through
all events in `eventCatalogue` and find events with clashing datetimes. This returns a hash map of an event to a list
of events that it clashes with.
