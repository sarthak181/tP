### Project: The Intern's Ship

**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for computing students looking for internships to more efficiently
manage their numerous internship applications. Suited for fast typers, TinS uses a combination of Command Line Interface
(CLI) to collect user inputs and Graphic User Interface (GUI) to display relevant information for ease of use.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view an added internship.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all information of an internship specified by the user.
  * Justification: This feature is a standard read function that is necessary for users to view all internship information they have saved on TinS.
  * Highlights: While `list` function shows only the internship position, company and unique auto-generated ID of all existing internships,
                this `view` function displays all saved information of one internship, including its application status, contact details and etc.

* **New Feature**: To be added soon.
