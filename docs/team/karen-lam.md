### Project: The Intern's Ship

**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for computing students looking for internships to more efficiently
manage their numerous internship applications. Suited for fast typers, TinS uses a combination of Command Line Interface
(CLI) to collect user inputs and Graphic User Interface (GUI) to display relevant information for ease of use.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view all internships.
    * What it does: allows the user to view all internships saved in TinS. Only internship position, company and unique
      auto-generated ID will be displayed
    * Justification: This feature is vital for users to efficiently use TinS as it displays only essential information
      of all internship a user has, avoiding screen clutter.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands.

* **New Feature**:
    * to be added soon...
